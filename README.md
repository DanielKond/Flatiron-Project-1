# Flatiron-Project-1
Flatiron Project 1 takes in the King County real estate data set and seeks to make insights into the statistics. Mainly, a forward-step/backward-step function is used to determine the most important predictors of house price. Additional insights include a visualization of the houses on a map, comparison of neighboring house prices, and whether the month sold affects the cost.
